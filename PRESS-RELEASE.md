# Sandpiper #

## The Event-Driven Behavioral Analytics Platform ##
  > Easy, accessible analytics for those who manage websites.

## Summary ##
  > Sandpiper is the easiest way to start tracking your website. In just minutes, you can start looking at not only how many people are making it to your site, but also what's most important: what's preventing digital viewers from becoming digital customers.

## Problem ##
  > Many companies struggle to figure out just how customers are interacting with their websites. Knowing pageviews and time spent is interesting, but that doesn't provide insight into what people are actually doing once they reach your site.

## Solution ##
  > Sandpiper's innovative event-driven software solves this mystery by paying attention to what people are clicking - not just how long the page was left open. Combined with other metrics, this allows you to follow users' paths through your website and figure out both what's catching - and what's losing - their attention.

## Quote from You ##
  > "Sandpiper tracks what's important to track, not just what's easy to track. It's not hard to figure out how many people make it to your site; what's hard is figuring out what buttons they're clicking, what they're doing when they're there. Sandpiper lets you start doing that in minutes."

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Some of those other website analytics platforms are just so complicated! I'm a small business owner, not an engineer. I needed something that would tell me what my customers actually do on my website that didn't require a Master's in computer science to set up. After struggling with other analytics for hours, I finally switched to Sandpiper and got it up and going in less than ten minutes!" -Ruby Conway, owner of Ruby's Scarves
